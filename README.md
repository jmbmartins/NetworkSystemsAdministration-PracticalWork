# README - ADMINISTRAÇÃO DE SISTEMAS EM REDE Project

## Project Description

This project focuses on configuring the communication network and implementing smart building features for XPTOtec, a technology-based company located in Covilhã. XPTOtec specializes in providing innovative services for smart cities, developing hardware and software solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). The project aims to set up the network infrastructure for the company's three buildings, as well as ensure that the buildings align with the company's philosophy.

## Scenario Overview

- XPTOtec is a rapidly growing company with 120 employees, and it is expected to double its workforce in the near future.
- The company's network is divided among three buildings: XPTOtec_Oriente (administrative services, customer support, and IT), XPTOtec_Nascente (development laboratories), and XPTOtec_Leste (warehouse and quality control testing for IoT solutions).
- The three buildings are geographically separated by a distance of 200 meters.
- The project involves configuring the communication network for all three buildings and implementing smart building features.

## Project Scope

- Network Configuration: The group is responsible for setting up the communication network infrastructure for all three buildings.
- Smart Building Implementation: The project includes implementing smart building features that align with the company's philosophy.
- Interconnection of Networks: The simulation tool provides a "multiuser connection" functionality to interconnect the networks of the three buildings.
- Internet Connection: The Internet connection must be established through the network of the XPTOtec_Oriente building.

## Repository Contents

- `documentation/`: This directory contains project documentation, including network configuration guidelines and smart building implementation details.
- `simulator_files/`: This directory includes the simulation files for each building (XPTOtec_Oriente, XPTOtec_Nascente, XPTOtec_Leste).
- `scripts/`: This directory contains any necessary scripts or automation tools for network configuration and smart building implementation.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the contents of the repository.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Refer to the documentation in the `documentation/` directory for detailed guidelines on network configuration and smart building implementation.
3. Use the provided simulation files in the `simulator_files/` directory to simulate the network for each building.
4. Follow the instructions in the documentation to interconnect the networks using the "multiuser connection" functionality.
5. Ensure the Internet connection is established through the network of the XPTOtec_Oriente building.
6. Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory, if applicable, to automate any configuration tasks or implementation steps.
